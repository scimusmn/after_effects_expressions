Snippets of After Effects code for video and animation manipulation

Cripes, did you realize that After Effects code is just [JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) with [some mangey additions](http://help.adobe.com/en_US/aftereffects/cs/using/WS3878526689cb91655866c1103906c6dea-7a0ca.html)?

These scripts are just little bits and scraps of code we've used in various After Effects projects.
